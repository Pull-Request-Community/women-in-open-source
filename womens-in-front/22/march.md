# How did you start contribute to Open Source:
As part of a my work on nested virtualization at IBM Research I started contributing to KVM/Qemu.

# Please summarize your contribution past the years:
KVM/Qemu: nested vmx, live migration improvements and maintenance
Ceph Radosgw (Object storage): Async Geo replication between clusters (DR), Dynamic bucket resharding, bug fixes and code reviews
OpenShift Data Foundation: design and code reviews.

# Do you have anything to say to a woman that starts her contribution to Open Source or maintain a library :
It doesn't have to be perfect, it is more important to release often and early and it is ok to make mistakes.
Take the leap and be heard. I know it is hard to get out there but we as women have so much to add to the community!
Find a welcoming community there are much more today
Ignore the critics and find a support group
